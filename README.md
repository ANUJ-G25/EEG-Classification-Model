# EEG-Classification-Model
In this project, I developed a classification model to analyze EEG data and categorize it into different types. Utilizing the CHB-MIT and Bonn EEG datasets, which include recordings from patients with epilepsy, I began by preprocessing the data to handle missing values and reduce noise. I extracted both time-domain and frequency-domain features from the EEG signals. For the classification model, I employed deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. To ensure the model's effectiveness, I implemented strategies to avoid overfitting and fine-tuned hyperparameters. The final results, including model predictions, were visualized through detailed plots and graphs, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately classify EEG data and its potential application in diagnosing epilepsy.
